# Birthday Love Letter

A single-page romantic celebration: the landing hero delivers an animated envelope love letter, and scrolling reveals a "Trip Down Memory Lane" showcase with your photos and highlight reel video.

## Highlights

- **3D envelope hero** with floating hearts and a shimmering starfield backdrop.
- **Immersive memory lane section** that plays your custom video and presents photo memories as animated, tilting cards.
- **Data-driven gallery** powered entirely on the front-end by `public/memory-data.js`, so you can swap photos without touching the markup.
- **No backend required**â€”drop images and a video into the `public/` folder and everything just works.

## Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser to see the love letter experience.
2. Add your photos to `public/images/` and update `public/memory-data.js` with the filenames plus any captions or metadata you want displayed.
3. Replace `public/video.mp4` (and optionally `public/video-poster.jpg`) with your own highlight reel for the memory section.
4. Click the **Trip Down Memory Lane** button on the hero to smoothly scroll to the interactive gallery and video.
